- set-cpu-state
    
    - different best performance settings based on detected CPU class?
    - fall back to defaults otherwise?
    - separate lookup table, or embed in library? -> library.  users can
      edit conf file if prefer different settings

- set-cpu-state

    - show all default settings with show-defaults option

        set-cpu-state {start|stop|...|show-defaults}
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^


- Add /etc/hpc-goodies/settings.conf which can be sourced be each tool
  to get the following settings:

    PARALLEL_SHELL_SYSTEM=(xcat|pdsh)
        # add others as appropriate



- "consider adding a "triggers" capability to set-cpu-state, so that
  after making changes, any "trigger scripts" get executed for
  post-processing.

  In other words, you run set-cpu-state and it turns off hyperthreading,
  then, a torque trigger script restarts torque so that the MOM reports
  the right number of cores for scheduling.


- "best practice configurations" via SSM and/or Puppet to include:
    - numad (maybe)
        - https://goo.gl/Kd1hB5
        - https://goo.gl/y7qwIp


- 
    New tool, proposed by Mark at TAMU:
    - ethernet.label_switch_ports

        Take xCAT node to port mappings, and set node name as label for
        each port in each Ethernet switch.

        - Helps in tracking down issues when monitoring for problems in
          switch fabric.

/etc/rc.d/init.d/set-cpu-state
    set defaults to:
        GOVERNER=performance
        USE_TURBO=yes
        USE_HYPERTHREADING=no
        C1E=off
        C_STATE_LIMIT=2

- backup_xcatdb -- Consider adding a "--git /path/to/local/repo" option
  that will do a nightly xCAT DB dump into the repository, rather than a
  date stamped directory, and commit all changes.

  This would allow for a very simple way to view changes made to the
  xCAT DB from day to day via "git diff" or through the web interface of
  an upstream repo tool, such as gitlab.

dma latency probabbly 
5:04:56 PM
◄
the number is the maximum allowed... uhh... nanoseconds I think... 
5:05:12 PM
◄
e.g. it *says* c2 takes 101 nanoseconds to come out of it, then that's
too high 
5:05:30 PM
◄
so you could say 'set_dma_latency 5' 
5:05:45 PM
◄
and it would be the same as 2 in our case since nothing takes more than
2 but less than 5 to come back 
5:06:09 PM
◄
so you are really saying a limit of c1 rather than c2 with that value

in set-cpu-state
    test for this case and handle gracefully:

         RUNNING: chkconfig set-cpu-state --add ; chkconfig set-cpu-state on ; /etc/init.d/set-cpu-state start

         /etc/init.d/hpc_goodies.functions: line 200: /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor: No such file or directory

handle firmware location for set_hca_firmware_update

    - default to stated firmware location?  
        /usr/share/hpc_goodies/firmware/hcas for HCAs
        /usr/share/hpc_goodies/firmware/uefi for node firmware?
        (used by set_uefi_firmware_update)
