/etc/rc.d/init.d/set_cpu_state
    set defaults to:
        GOVERNER=performance
        USE_TURBO=yes
        USE_HYPERTHREADING=no
        C1E=off
        C_STATE_LIMIT=2

- backup_xcatdb -- Consider adding a "--git /path/to/local/repo" option
  that will do a nightly xCAT DB dump into the repository, rather than a
  date stamped directory, and commit all changes.

  This would allow for a very simple way to view changes made to the
  xCAT DB from day to day via "git diff" or through the web interface of
  an upstream repo tool, such as gitlab.

dma latency probabbly 
5:04:56 PM
◄
the number is the maximum allowed... uhh... nanoseconds I think... 
5:05:12 PM
◄
e.g. it *says* c2 takes 101 nanoseconds to come out of it, then that's
too high 
5:05:30 PM
◄
so you could say 'set_dma_latency 5' 
5:05:45 PM
◄
and it would be the same as 2 in our case since nothing takes more than
2 but less than 5 to come back 
5:06:09 PM
◄
so you are really saying a limit of c1 rather than c2 with that value

in set_cpu_state
    test for this case and handle gracefully:

         RUNNING: chkconfig set_cpu_state --add ; chkconfig set_cpu_state on ; /etc/init.d/set_cpu_state start

         /etc/init.d/hpc_goodies.functions: line 200: /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor: No such file or directory

handle firmware location for set_hca_firmware_update

    - default to stated firmware location?  
        /usr/share/hpc_goodies/firmware/hcas for HCAs
        /usr/share/hpc_goodies/firmware/uefi for node firmware?
        (used by set_uefi_firmware_update)
