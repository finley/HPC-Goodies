SYNOPSIS

    $progname ETHERNET_MAC_ADDRESS [MY_INTERFACE_NAME]

DESCRIPTION

    $progname will take the provided Ethernet MAC address and return an IPv6
    link local address.  Where MY_INTERFACE_NAME is the interface on the
    machine from which you will originate traffic to the target IPv6 address,
    that is on the same physical link as the target interface.  Defaults to
    "eth0" if not specified.

    Example:
        # $progname 00:50:b6:78:80:2f eth1
        fe80::250:b6ff:fe78:802f%eth1

        # ping6 fe80::250:b6ff:fe78:802f%eth1
        PING fe80::250:b6ff:fe78:802f%eth1(fe80::250:b6ff:fe78:802f) 56 data bytes
        64 bytes from fe80::250:b6ff:fe78:802f: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.062 ms
        64 bytes from fe80::250:b6ff:fe78:802f: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.061 ms
        etc.

        NOTE:  You won't actually be able to ping the example address above, as
        it is on my notebook, and therefore not on the same physical link as
        your machine. ;-)  (most likely...)
