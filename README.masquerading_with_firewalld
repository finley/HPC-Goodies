#
#   HOWTO Enable Masquerading for your Cluster with firewalld
#

#
#   To enable masquerading, identify your externally facing interface(s) (that
#   is the interface(s) that send packets to your default gateway).  Here's a
#   command that should give you a list of those interfaces:

ip route | grep default | sed -e 's/.* dev //' -e 's/ .*//'

#   Example:
#
#     ┌─[bfinley@xbob4] ~/src/hpc-goodies/
#     └─[$] ip route | grep default | sed -e 's/.* dev //' -e 's/ .*//'
#     wlan0


#
#   Each of your interfaces should already be in a zone.  To get a list of your
#   active zones and the interfaces assigned to each zone, do this:

firewall-cmd --get-active-zones           

#   Example:
#
#     ┌─[bfinley@xbob4] ~/src/hpc-goodies/
#     └─[$] sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones           
#     public
#       interfaces: enu0 enp0 vmnet8 vmnet1 enusb0 wwp0s20f0u2i12 wlan0


#
# 	Now that we know the externally facing interface (wlan0) and which zone
# 	it's assigned to (public), we can add a masquerading rule to the public
# 	zone.  By adding a masquerading rule to the public zone, we're telling the
# 	firewall to masquerade all traffic that is headed out of the public zone.
# 	It's not necessary to add any other masquerade related configuration
# 	settings to any other zone.
#   
#   Here's the command:

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-masquerade
firewall-cmd --reload

#
#   That's it!
